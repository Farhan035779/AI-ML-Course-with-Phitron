    "#### Project Name: \n",
    "##### Smart Vehicle Classifier\n",
    "#### Description\n",
    "##### This project simulates a simple AI-based vehicle classifier using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).\n",
    "##### It demonstrates inheritance, protected and private members, method overriding, and encapsulation.\n",
    "##### The program manages two types of vehicles: Car and Bike. Each class inherits from a base class Vehicle.\n",
    "##### A simple classifier method predicts the type of vehicle based on its speed threshold.\n",
    "#### Task Statement\n",
    "##### Design and implement a simple program that classifies vehicles based on their type and speed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.\n",
    "#### You must:\n",
    "##### Create a base class Vehicle that stores vehicle type, name, and speed.\n",
    "##### Use protected and private attributes in the base class to demonstrate encapsulation.\n",
    "##### Implement a method classify() that categorizes vehicles as High-speed Vehicle if the speed is greater than 100, otherwise Normal Vehicle.\n",
    "##### Derive two subclasses — Car and Bike — from Vehicle. Each should override the show_info() method to display detailed information.\n",
    "##### Read multiple inputs representing different vehicles, create corresponding objects, and print their details along with their classification results.\n",
    "#### Input\n",
    "##### 3\n",
    "##### Car Toyota 150\n",
    "##### Bike Yamaha 90\n",
    "##### Car Honda 120\n",
    "#### Output\n",
    "##### Car Added: Toyota\n",
    "##### Bike Added: Yamaha\n",
    "##### Car Added: Honda\n",
    "#### --- Vehicle Details ---\n",
    "##### Type: Car, Name: Toyota, Speed: 150 km/h, Predicted: High-speed Vehicle\n",
    "##### Type: Bike, Name: Yamaha, Speed: 90 km/h, Predicted: Normal Vehicle\n",
    "##### Type: Car, Name: Honda, Speed: 120 km/h, Predicted: High-speed Vehicle\n",
    "#### Short Hint\n",
    "##### Use a base class Vehicle with protected and private attributes.\n",
    "##### Create subclasses Car and Bike that override show_info() and add a simple speed-based classifier.\n",
    "##### Speed above 100 is considered a \"High-speed Vehicle\"."
